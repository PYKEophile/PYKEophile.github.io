# PYKE, the bloodharbor ripper
 A harpooner from the slaughter docks of Bilgewater,
 Pyke met his death in the belly of a gigantic shark…
 but he returned stalking Bilgewater, using his supernatural
 gifts to bring an end to those who exploit others—and a city
 that prides itself on hunting monsters is hunted by one.
